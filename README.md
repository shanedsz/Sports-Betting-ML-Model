# Sports-Betting-ML-Model
The goal of this project is to help people who are placing bets on NBA and EPL games to have a
higher probability of winning their bet. We will use machine learning algorithms
(RandomForest, LogisticRegression, and Sequential), to make predictions, as well as compare
the accuracy of these models. The end product will be a chatbox utilizing AWS Lex which a user
will be able to ask for the predicted winner of a game they choose.
# Objectives:
1. Find reliable and accurate data to using Kaggle. The data we are looking for will be for
more than 10 seasons and will include over 10 columns of statistics, for every game
played in every season
2. Perform data cleaning on the data and prepare it for machine learning algorithms (dropna,
OneHotEncoder, etc.)
3. Create three different .py files with a function that runs each of the algorithms mentioned
(RandomForest, LogisticRegression, and Sequential)
4. Run the data through the functions and test their accuracy for comparison
5. Create a Amazon Web Services Bot which informs client on the pick according to the algorithm 

# Why use the AWS Bot?

This bot is also connected to a number which you can call and get the pick you request according to the game you bet on
AWS Chatbot is an interactive agent that makes it easier to monitor and interact with your AWS resources in your Slack channels and chat channels. 
By using AWS Chatbot, you can receive alerts and run commands to return diagnostic information, invoke AWS Lambda functions, and create AWS Support cases so that your team can collaborate and respond to events faster.

We used the bot so we could quickly discover and act on cost anomalies, gain near real-time visibility into anomalous spend with AWS Cost Anomaly Detection alert notifications in Slack by using AWS Chatbot. This also allowed us to learn more about cost anomaly detection.
We ran AWS Command Line Interface commands from Slack channels to remediate your security findings.

In the future this bot will allow us to respond better to security issues and improve incident management response times. We could then collaborate and resolve IT incidents faster from chat channels with AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager.
